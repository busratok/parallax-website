      <h2>Builds full-body strength</h2>
      <p>
        <span>Building strength</span> doesn't have to be done solely through
        gym workouts or strength training sessions. In fact, using your own body
        weight as resistance is a form of resistance training and can be a great
        (and free) way to build strength across your entire body. For example,
        <span>Chaturanga</span> (a key flowing transition in Yoga) builds
        strength in your upper body and core whilst Warrior poses works your
        lower body (hamstrings, quads and glutes). Pick stronger styles like
        <span>Vinyasa, Hatha, Power and Rocket</span> to build muscular
        endurance and strength – just make sure to skew it to your level. Most
        teachers will give modification advice to make the poses easier, so
        listen out.

      <h2>Helps to reduce stress and build stress resilience</h2>
      <p>
        We get it. It’s hard not to feel more than slightly wired (read:
        stressed out) with emails and social updates erupting out of your inbox.
        That’s where yoga comes in. Shown by Coventry University to “reverse”
        the DNA reactions that cause stress, yoga also lowers levels of
        inflammatory compounds (cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the blood.
        'Stress makes us tense physically and mentally. Our flight or fight
        response activates, we get adrenaline rushes and our body releases
        cortisol which increases our heart rate and sends the blood to the
        muscles,' describes MoreYoga instructor Anna de Sousa. 'Yoga helps us
        tune in with our rest and digest nervous system response, instead. Our
        body starts its recovery, restore and repair functions.'

      <h2>Improves balance</h2>
      <p>
        As we age our centre of gravity can shift, this can make it harder to
        maintain balance. This is due to the liquid that lubricates our joints
        (synovial fluid) declining as we get older. Add into the mix that our
        ligaments also tend to lose moisture and elasticity and we have an issue
        of rigidity and stiffness on our hands. Exercise stimulates the
        production of synovial fluid, which is why it's so important to stay
        moving as we get older. Experts suggest working against resistance to
        build strength and improve balance simultaneously, something yoga is
        brilliant for.

      <h2>Beginners can start with breathing</h2>
      <p>
        If you're not ready to jump into the physical poses (called 'asanas'),
        breathing is an important part of any yoga practice to get to grips
        with, too. 'Deep breathing (learning to use the diaphragm – our primary
        inhalation muscle), to its full capacity, is one of the best yoga
        exercises for beginners,' says Indaba yoga instructor, Sabina Ahmadov.
        'You learn how to avoid using accessory muscles to breathe i.e. neck,
        upper chest and jaw muscles. Learning how to breathe properly before
        delving into the physical practice is extremely important because it
        creates a healthy foundation to build a physical practice that is
        grounding and nourishing.'
